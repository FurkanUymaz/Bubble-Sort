First of all ı expanded the bubble_sort definition for Linked List. After that ı got an error about the iteration. Then ı create a __iter__ definition into to LinkedList class. YMAL docs is already in the directory so ı didn't anything about that. And ı add the -3 into the list for sorting and its worked on the main doc. After that ı create the .ignore code from the P4 slide and ı push to the repo. I use the chat-GPT for the learn easily the __iter__ function but ı didn't stop with the get the iter function. I learn the description of the terms.

ERROR and FAILURE

Error is the mistake on the task,code,steps etc..
Failure is the unwanted result like unexcepted output the code, leaning shelf etc..
